### 🎉 What’s Inside the Magic Box?

**Split View Magic**
Write your raw Markdown on the left, and watch it come to life on the right! It’s like having a tiny wizard in your browser, casting spells to turn your words into beautiful docs.

**AI Brainstorm Buddy**
Stuck? Let the AI take over! The bottom AI pane will continue your thoughts without messing up your work. It’s like having a coding buddy who’s always ready to help—but without the coffee breath.

**Rewrite Wizardry**
Highlight some text, right-click, and boom! The AI will polish your words like a pro. Perfect for when you want to sound smart without actually trying.

**Notes for Nerds**
Got extra context or random thoughts? Throw them into the Notes panel, and the AI will use them to make your writing even better. It’s like giving your AI a cheat sheet!

**Workspace Wonderland**
Create new projects with a single click. No project? No problem! You can still work, but saving is disabled—so don’t forget to create one before you get too deep into your genius ideas.

**Image Paste Party**
Copy-paste images directly into the editor, and they’ll be saved in your project directory. It’s like magic, but with fewer rabbits and more Markdown.

**Save & Autosave**
Your work is safe with Asta. Save manually or let autosave do its thing—either way, your genius won’t be lost.
